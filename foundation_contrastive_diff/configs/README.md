# Run configs

YAML configs for `training.train_foundation_diff`. A config's values become the arg
defaults; anything you pass on the CLI still overrides it. Each run also writes its fully
resolved parameters to `<save_folder>/run_config.json` (a record of exactly what ran).

## Usage
```bash
python -u -m training.train_foundation_diff --config configs/last1_l1l2.yaml
# override anything on the CLI:
python -u -m training.train_foundation_diff --config configs/last1_l1l2.yaml --epochs 40 --lr 2e-4
```

## Available
| config | features | loss | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `last1_l1l2.yaml` | last-1 (90 GB cache, fast) | L1+L2 | needs `fcd_cache_last1` (re-cache with LAST_N_LAYERS=1) |
| `last4_l1l2.yaml` | last-4 (360 GB cache) | L1+L2 | NFS-bound ~20 min/epoch |
| `overfit_l1l2.yaml` | last-4 | L1+L2 | capacity sanity test (16 pairs, 400 ep) |

Loss default here is **L1+L2 (no Dice)** — the overfit test showed Dice hurts on the faint GT.
